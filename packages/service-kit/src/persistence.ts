// Persistence boot policy (security-audit.md M6 / FIX 7; inverted per RA-4).
//
// The old behavior silently degraded to in-memory repositories whenever
// DATABASE_URL was unset OR Postgres was unreachable, and /health still
// reported "ok" — so a misconfigured production instance served traffic on
// volatile state (audit log, session list, and — since FIX 1/FIX 3 — the
// funding-path scoping and spend budgets all depend on durable state).
//
// FIX 7 gated fail-closed on `NODE_ENV === "production"`. RA-4: NOTHING sets
// NODE_ENV=production on the deploy targets (@vellar/all-in-one runs via
// `tsx src/index.ts`; no render.yaml/railway.json/.env sets it), so that guard
// was inert and the instance silently degraded — fail-OPEN by default. A missing
// env var meant "not production" meant "less safe."
//
// INVERTED: the default is FAIL-CLOSED. In-memory is the less-safe branch, so it
// requires an EXPLICIT signal — either ALLOW_INMEMORY=1 (operator opt-in) or an
// explicitly non-production NODE_ENV (`development`/`test`). An UNSET NODE_ENV —
// the deploy-target reality — no longer degrades; it refuses to boot without a
// durable DB. Local dev keeps working (tsx watch/Next set development; Vitest
// sets test; or set ALLOW_INMEMORY=1).
